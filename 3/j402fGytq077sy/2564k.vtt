00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Narrator>These electric cars</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.600
used to be the latest technology

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.870
on China's roads, but now hundreds

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.080
of these models lie forgotten in the giant clearing

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.440
lost waves of new and improved Electric Cars.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.480
<v ->The city of Hangzhou is littered</v>

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.250
with electric vehicle graveyards.

8
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.280
Just like this one, China has shifted rapidly

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.480
to electric cars.

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.150
The US is worried that Chinese car makers

11
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.400
could flood its markets with cheap

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.820
and good electric cars posing a challenge

13
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.473
to the American auto industry.

14
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Narrator>Outdated EVs have been left in fields like this</v>

15
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.410
across China's eastern city of Hangzhou

16
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.450
over the past few years.

17
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.620
<v ->This EV Graveyard has hundreds of electric cars</v>

18
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.650
and the Chinese government has pumped money

19
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.940
into this sector.

20
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.460
There has been technology developing very quickly

21
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.010
in terms of the electric vehicle models.

22
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.830
That also means that the older vehicles become obsolete

23
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.183
relatively quickly.

24
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Narrator>Washington is worried that an oversupply</v>

25
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.050
of Chinese EV will flood the global market

26
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.503
and there are already signs of a deluge of EVs in China.

27
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.120
In Hangzhou, we came across hundreds of new EVs

28
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.753
stored out in the open, many of them waiting to be sold.

29
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.060
China has the ability to produce roughly twice as many cars

30
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.980
as it sells at home each year.

31
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.630
The government has thrown its weight

32
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.210
behind the EV industry to cement China's global lead.

33
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.440
<v ->China has the entire ecosystem working for it.</v>

34
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.460
China has battery.

35
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.670
China has all lithium war,

36
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.430
and the entire value chain is predominantly Chinese.

37
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.760
So eventually winner is going to be China.

38
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Narrator>That threatens companies like Tesla,</v>

39
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.345
which briefly lost its crown as the top EV seller

40
00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:52.380
to China's BYD last year.

41
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.780
<v ->There's a lot of people who out there</v>

42
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.140
who think like the top 10 car companies are gonna be Tesla

43
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.480
followed by nine Chinese car companies.

44
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.100
I think they might not be wrong.

45
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Narrator>Chinese automakers have already</v>

46
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.460
been shipping more electric cars

47
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.210
to Europe raising competition for local players.

48
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.483
The US doesn't want that to happen on its own shores.

49
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.220
To get ahead of the curve, president Biden announced

50
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.190
that he will impose a 100% tariff

51
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.020
on Chinese electric vehicles.

52
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.760
<v ->I'm determined that the future</v>

53
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.190
of electric vehicles will be made in America

54
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.229
by union workers, period.

55
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.244
(crowd applauding)

56
00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:33.180
(upbeat music)

57
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Narrator>Despite resistance from the US,</v>

58
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.040
China's EV industry is growing.

59
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.980
The Beijing Auto Show is a chance for car makers

60
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.610
to show off their new EVs before they hit the market.

61
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.290
The sector has attracted dozens

62
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.100
of new players over the years trying to cash in on the boom.

63
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.560
One of them is Xiaomi a tech giant,

64
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.530
best known for its consumer gadgets.

65
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.790
<v ->This is the Xiaomi car.</v>

66
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.850
If you place an order today, you have to wait about six

67
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.010
or seven months to get this car,

68
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.110
and this is probably one of the hottest cars

69
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.430
at this auto show.

70
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.190
Many people are lining up for 30 minutes

71
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.103
or more just to get into this booth to try out this car.

72
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.300
<v Narrator>The company already has around 70,000 orders</v>

73
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.900
in China and says it's highly automated plant.

74
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.440
It's able to build a car every 76 seconds.

75
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.530
Xiaomi SU wants to eventually ship its cars

76
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.550
around the world.

77
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.810
<v ->If anyone wants to start a conventional car company,</v>

78
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.240
they need to have million, hundreds of thousands

79
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.830
of components to come together.

80
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.270
Whereas EVs, the entry barrier is significantly lower.

81
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.570
Components are fewer components are prepackaged,

82
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.790
and therefore, if you and me decide to buy

83
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.560
a starter EV company,

84
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.350
it is relatively easy, it's possible.

85
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Narrator>American automakers may also face competition</v>

86
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.050
from established companies like BYD

87
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.810
known for mass producing affordable cars.

88
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.300
It wants to build a factory in Mexico,

89
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.030
which could help it circumvent the hefty tariffs

90
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.313
that the US has on Chinese vehicles.

91
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.210
BYD's cheapest DV model, the Seagull

92
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.153
is sold at around $10,000 in China.

93
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.820
Under the new US Tariff,

94
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.300
a buyer in America would end up paying at least double

95
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.253
that amount for the same car.

96
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.240
China, which firmly opposes the new tariffs,

97
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.060
is already the world's biggest auto exporter.

98
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.080
But gasoline cars still make up a big part of the export.

99
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.520
The US is concerned

100
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.043
that the exports will soon include more EVs.

101
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.730
<v ->You look at American automotive history,</v>

102
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.270
earlier they had the GM 4 Chrysler.

103
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.280
Then Japanese went there.

104
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.210
Now it's the third wave.

105
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.280
Now it's Chinese knocking on their doors

106
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.810
and there is nothing you can do

107
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.180
once you say that you are open market,

108
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.030
you want to promote global marketplace, et cetera,

109
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.080
there is nothing you can do to stop them.

110
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Narrator>US automakers pioneered electric vehicles</v>

111
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.910
and the technology that drives them,

112
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.220
but now they're playing catch up in a race

113
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.692
to the top with China.

114
00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:09.275
(gentle music)
