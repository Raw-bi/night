1
00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.071
Deserted shopping malls,

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.240
half-empty apartment complexes,

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.010
abandoned construction sites.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.014
These are all signs of the crisis that has gripped China's property market.

5
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:18.485
And also an illustration of how dramatically the fortunes of the sector

6
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.487
have changed in the last few years.

7
00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.921
Homebuyers are afraid of

8
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.757
not getting the home that they paid for.

9
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.425
The problems China have now

10
00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.260
are deep-seated structural ones.

11
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.863
I think the consensus is already that for China,

12
00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.766
the property sales may not go back to yesterday.

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.002
China's property market is in a bunch of trouble.

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:40.874
And because property is the single-biggest contributor to China's GDP,

15
00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.243
when the property sector is in trouble,

16
00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.513
the rest of the economy is in trouble as well.

17
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.921
To understand why the property
crisis has happened now,

18
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.023
you have to go back a few years.

19
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:02.195
In the early 2000s, there was an
enormous construction boom here.

20
00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.297
Skyscrapers, apartment complexes,

21
00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.932
they were going up everywhere.

22
00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:10.937
There was this fundamental belief
that property prices could only go up.

23
00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.206
That belief has been shaken tremendously.

24
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.808
And when you speak to people now,

25
00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:19.946
there’s a real worry that maybe
what follows a boom is bust.

26
00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.833
The privatization of property that began in the 1990s

27
00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:44.270
created one of the largest explosions
of wealth in the country’s history.

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.575
China’s housing stock was
dilapidated and low quality.

29
00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.479
Many people living in worn out dormitories

30
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.150
or housing provided by their state-owned
enterprise or government ministry.

31
00:01:58.685 --> 00:01:59.986
China was urbanizing,

32
00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:03.590
with tens of millions moving
from the countryside to the city,

33
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.291
and China was getting richer.

34
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.759
All of these things together

35
00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.797
would already have driven an
enormous boom in China’s real estate.

36
00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.467
The trouble was, other factors also contributed.

37
00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.004
Domestically, the stock market has been tumultuous.

38
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.840
There have been people who have made
a lot of money in the stock market

39
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.543
and also a lot of people who
have lost a lot of money.

40
00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.979
At the same time, property was steady,

41
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.848
it just continued going up, up and up.

42
00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:30.783
And so people began buying homes,

43
00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:35.288
not to live in them, but as a way
to invest their money.

44
00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.490
For years there had been warnings

45
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.691
about the borrowing binge

46
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.661
and the building binge
in China’s property sector.

47
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.732
Chinese developers would launch a project for pre-sales,

48
00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.700
get the money from the homebuyers,

49
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.203
and immediately invest a sum of money

50
00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:53.540
into new land parcels to keep expanding.

51
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.810
It all worked fine until sales suddenly tumbled.

52
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.646
New cash stopped coming in

53
00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.215
and developers find they don't have enough cash

54
00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:06.819
to finish the construction of homes previously pre-sold.

55
00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.589
The build up of the bubbles went on unchecked,

56
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.558
but as long as people kept buying,

57
00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.560
and there’s a lot of investment demand

58
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.062
snapping up the oversupply of housing,

59
00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.932
investors and developers felt great.

60
00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.568
That’s until the party stopped.

61
00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.170
In comes Xi Jinping.

62
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.707
In the beginning of his second term
as China’s leader in 2017,

63
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:30.610
he really starts putting his shoulder into this mantra

64
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.947
that homes are for living in, not for speculating on.

65
00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:37.517
China’s efforts to tighten regulation over its developers

66
00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.019
culminated in the unveiling of what’s become known

67
00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.722
as the three red lines policy in 2020.

68
00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:47.427
It greatly limited the ability of those firms to get financing.

69
00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:50.863
A lot of smaller companies ran
into trouble almost immediately.

70
00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:54.067
Then Evergrande, once the country’s biggest developer,

71
00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.569
warned of a potential cash crunch.

72
00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.304
A year later it was in default,

73
00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:01.107
sending shockwaves through global markets.

74
00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:02.609
The day has finally come, Shery.

75
00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.410
We've been circling around this

76
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.814
what has very recently felt like a complete inevitability, right?

77
00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:11.751
But Evergrande now is declaring officially in default.

78
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.954
Problems at Evergrande were well recognized.

79
00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:17.991
Hedge funds had been shorting the stock for years.

80
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:21.995
The surprise though was the shift in government policy

81
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:25.832
from standing behind the debts of big property developers

82
00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.768
to allowing them to go under.

83
00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.471
Dozens of private developers have since collapsed,

84
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:35.008
raising not only questions about the
future of the property market in China

85
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:37.810
but about the health of the entire economy.

86
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.179
The latest to struggle, Country Garden

87
00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.849
was once the country’s largest developer by sales

88
00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.319
and a company many saw as too big to fail.

89
00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.021
Country Garden, obviously the latest

90
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.790
poster child of the property sector woes.

91
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.428
The fallen fortunes of Country Garden you
can basically see it in a 10-year chart.

92
00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.830
The two debt crises is very different.

93
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.467
Country Garden has over 3,000 projects across China,

94
00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.469
and that’s four times Evergrande.

95
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.539
For Evergrande, when it went bust in 2021,

96
00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.842
the government can still call it an isolated event

97
00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:14.147
and it’s due to the company’s own
management and reckless expansion.

98
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.650
For a developer of Country Garden’s status to stumble,

99
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.952
it’s more detrimental to sentiment

100
00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:23.022
because it’s telling you that
something is fundamentally wrong

101
00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.557
with China’s housing market

102
00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:30.463
that’s pushing even formerly healthy
developers to the brink of collapse.

103
00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.399
As the developers suffered, construction stopped.

104
00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.736
Homebuyers realized the properties
they had already paid for,

105
00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:40.540
had taken out a mortgage to buy, were not being built.

106
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.209
Anger and protests grew.

107
00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:55.888
This is really the big concern.

108
00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.990
Throughout all of the crackdown,

109
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.826
is whether or not we’re going to see

110
00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:02.895
social unrest and financial instability.

111
00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.931
The government has stepped in to push banks

112
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:06.866
to continue lending to developers

113
00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.901
so that they have the money to finish the homes

114
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.704
that they’ve already sold and make sure that those homes

115
00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.506
are delivered to the buyers.

116
00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.841
The government has also stepped in

117
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:19.846
to ask the banks to lower the interest rates
they charge on mortgages.

118
00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:32.859
80% of the wealth of the average Chinese
household is tied up in their homes.

119
00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.194
When that home price goes down, they feel poorer,

120
00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.195
they spend less,

121
00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:40.066
and that has been a real drag on the economy this year.

122
00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.536
The risks to the financial system
we’ve already started to see.

123
00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:46.372
Zhongrong, a big trust company here in China,

124
00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.474
a trillion yuan under management,

125
00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.577
has not been able to pay some of its
products when it comes due

126
00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:54.213
because they lent a lot of money to developers

127
00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:55.948
and they themselves have not been paid.

128
00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:59.419
If we start seeing problems in China’s banks,

129
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.456
if there are concerns about a Lehman moment for China,

130
00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:06.092
what we could see is a global

131
00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.429
risk-off moment for financial markets.

132
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.165
It wouldn't just be Australia and Chile

133
00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.501
and the other commodity producers that will be suffering.

134
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.503
It would be the big financial centers

135
00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:21.474
here in the United States, in London and elsewhere.

136
00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.578
When Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008,

137
00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:29.315
it marked the beginning of a global financial crisis.

138
00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.451
We’ve had a historic day on Wall Street.

139
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.020
Lehman Brothers, the 158-year-old firm,

140
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.424
filed for Chapter 11 protection in US bankruptcy court today.

141
00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:41.360
But there are some key differences
between what happened then

142
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.796
and what’s happening in China today.

143
00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:48.701
Banks in China are much more
straightforward in their operations

144
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:53.706
than the Wall Street whizkids that contributed
to the global financial crisis.

145
00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:58.478
China’s banking system has very ample sources of funding

146
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.981
and has the government standing squarely behind it.

147
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:06.018
Does that guarantee that China will escape a financial crisis

148
00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:08.454
as the real estate sector collapses?

149
00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:12.225
No, but it gives them a fighting chance.

150
00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:17.396
If China’s economy stumbles,
the global implications will be far reaching,

151
00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.832
touching anyone who’s benefited from having the country

152
00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:23.202
as a supplier or as an end consumer.

153
00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.339
Geopolitically, a weakened Chinese
economy could force Beijing

154
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.543
to reconsider how it pursues its rivalry with Washington.

155
00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.912
And if other nations begin wondering whether

156
00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:35.648
China is a superpower approaching its peak,

157
00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:40.786
the way the world deals with Beijing
may be in for a lot of rethinking.
